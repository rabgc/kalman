# Kalman filter project

Under development. Not ready for use.  

## Introduction
Implements a Kalman Filter for state vector estimation for the simplified yet common case in which the time step, state transition, and design matrices all remain constant over the experiment.

The state vector can be multi-dimensional, and the state vectors can be stacked to track multile objects (stations, satellites, etc).

The KalmanFilter class provides methods for predicting and updating a state vector and its covariance matrix for a given state transition model.
